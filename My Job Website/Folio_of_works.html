                        I transferred from photography into videography after 2 years of being an enthusiastic photographer, so I naturally have a lot more photos than videos when you combine the factors that make practicing videography hard for me (lack of access to actors etc.)

                        I have far fewer videos than photos, I find it hard to practice as only one of my parents will ever want to be in the video 
                        and they are really busy. But now that I have started to do media as a subject this year, I will have many more opportunities. 
                        But this doesn’t mean I am poorly practiced I have filmed boxing matches, I am in my schools 
                        film crew so I am filming at the live events they do also I have done some solo VFX projects and some short films (that admittedly don’t 
                        have a good story since my expertise are within camerawork not story-writing).

                        This was the first project where I did it over the course of multiple months was a music video done to smash mouths All Star, unfortunately during the most important
                         stage of planning half my group got covid and then during filming I and the other half who didn’t get covid during planning, got covid. So, I had to cut the song short 
                         and also film some parts of me lip-syncing instead of the person who was meant to be lip-syncing. But otherwise, it was a good project.

                        This was a quick excersise I did when I was 12, this was just after learning how to use after effects. I did the sound design, effects and edits myself
                        and yes, I was in pyjamas I did not think of making it look proffesional when I was 12.

                        another one of my projects was filming some interviews for a local boxing group called the "Dawn Patrol Boxing" youtube chanel <button><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6_jaOU0VS65Rlr0dyuvN6A">here</a></button>
                        Note: I only filmed the interviews and the first fight night <b>I did not film the fights on fight night 2</b> but you can see me getting some footage there as well
